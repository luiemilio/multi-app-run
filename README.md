# Running multiple applications

This application demonstrates a very simple way of launching multiple OpenFin applications at the same time. A launcher application is launched first, from the launcher another application can be launched which then creates and launches 10 applications concurrently.

### How to use this:

* Clone this repository.
* Install the dependencies: `cd multi-app-run` & `npm install`.
* Start the live-server and launch the application: `npm start`.
* Click the Launch Application button.
* The newly launched application should then launch 10 applications automatically.
